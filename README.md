Website Project Proposal: The Daily Crumb

Organisation Overview • Name: The Daily Crumb • Brief History: The Daily Crumb is a small, family-owned bakery established in 2018. It specializes in artisanal bread, pastries, and custom-ordered celebration cakes. The business has grown a loyal local following through word-of-mouth and a strong social media presence but lacks a dedicated online platform for sales and information. • Mission Statement: To bake and serve high-quality, delicious, and lovingly crafted baked goods that bring joy to our community. We believe in using the finest local ingredients and traditional baking techniques to create exceptional products. • Vision Statement: To be the most cherished and trusted local bakery, known for our commitment to quality, creativity, and community engagement. • Target Audience: Our primary target audience includes local residents in the 25-60 age range who value high-quality, artisanal food. This includes families ordering birthday cakes, individuals looking for daily bread, and local businesses seeking custom baked goods for events.
Website Goals and Objectives The primary goal of this website project is to establish a strong online presence for The Daily Crumb to support business growth and improve customer engagement. The specific objectives are: • Increase Website Traffic: Drive local traffic to the new website through search engine optimization (SEO) and social media promotion. • Generate Leads and Sales: Implement an e-commerce system to allow customers to view the full product range, place orders for pickup or local delivery, and book custom cake consultations. • Improve Customer Experience: Provide a single, reliable source for information on our menu, business hours, location, and contact details, reducing inquiries made via phone and social media.
Current Website Analysis Currently, The Daily Crumb does not have a formal website. Its online presence is limited to an active Instagram page and a basic Google Business Profile. While effective for visual marketing, this fragmented approach makes it difficult for customers to find comprehensive information, browse a full menu, or place orders directly. This lack of a central hub is a significant weakness, as potential customers may be lost in the process of trying to contact the bakery or place an order. A dedicated website will centralize all information and streamline the purchasing process.
Proposed Website Features and Functionality The website will be designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, with the following key features: • Homepage: A welcoming page with high-quality images, a brief introduction to the bakery, and direct links to key sections like the menu and online store. • Menu/Products Page: A detailed catalogue of all our products, categorized for easy navigation (e.g., Bread, Pastries, Cakes). Each item will have a description and price. • Online Store: A secure e-commerce platform for customers to add items to a cart and checkout for local pickup or delivery. This will include options for custom cake orders and special requests. • About Us Page: A page detailing the bakery’s history, mission, and the story of the owners to build brand trust and a personal connection with customers. • Contact Page: A page with our address, business hours, a map, and a contact form for inquiries. • Blog/News Section: A simple blog to share baking tips, new product announcements, and behind-the-scenes content, further engaging the audience and improving SEO.
Design and User Experience (UX) The design will aim for a warm, rustic, and handcrafted aesthetic that reflects the bakery’s brand identity. • Colour Scheme (Proposed Colour Palette): A palette of warm, earthy tones: creams, deep browns, and a subtle accent of sky blue. This palette will evoke feelings of comfort, warmth, and natural goodness. • Typography (Font Choices and Hierarchy): We will use a clean, modern sans-serif font for body text to ensure readability (e.g., Lato). For headings and logos, a slightly more decorative serif or script font will be used to convey a handcrafted, artisanal feel (e.g., Playfair Display or a custom script). • Layout and Design (Overall Design Approach): The layout will be clean, with plenty of white space to prevent a cluttered feel. High-quality, professional photography of the products will be a central design element. The website will be fully responsive to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. • User Experience Considerations: The navigation will be clear and logical, with a simple main menu. The checkout process will be designed to be as simple as possible, requiring a minimal number of steps. Low-fidelity wireframes will be developed to map out the user journey and ensure a smooth flow from Browse to purchase.
Technical Requirements • Hosting and Domain: A reliable web hosting service with an SSL certificate is required. The domain name will be thedailycrumb.co.za. • Programming Languages and Frameworks: The website will be built using a robust, content-management system (CMS) such as WordPress, which offers flexibility and a wide range of e-commerce plugins. Front-end technologies will include HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
Timeline and Milestones • Week 1-2: Project kick-off, research, and proposal finalisation. • Week 3-4: Design and wireframing of the website layout. • Week 5-6: Content creation and photography. • Week 7-9: Website development (front-end and back-end). • Week 10: Testing, quality assurance, and deployment. • Week 11-12: Final review and launch.
Budget The estimated budget for this project includes: • Development: R15,000 - R20,000 (includes design, e-commerce integration, and basic SEO). • Hosting & Domain: R1,500 per year.
